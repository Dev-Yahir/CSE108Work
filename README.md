In this lab the goal of my work was to implement designs for the entire website with the inclusion of some Database functionalities

### CSE108 Final Project

For the final project we were tasked with creating our own unique website. My team and I decided to do a Calendar website that doubled as a journaling website. It allowed the user to store daily journals and notes as well as create tasks, events, and to-do lists for specific days. I was in charge of the front and back-end of the journal portion and some design choices.
